My new game mode is "Console Eras". In this mode, you match the Console names to the Console Generation they released in.

I also added a main menu, where you select the difficulty and game mode, and a results screen after playing, where you can see your total score (with an added time bonus), correct and incorrect answers, time remaining, and the current game mode and difficulty. In the game itself, I added a combo counter that tracks consecutive correct answers and an improved scoring system. Finally, I added sound effects and music to enhance the overall experience.
